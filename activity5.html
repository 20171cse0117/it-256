<p>In June 2009, Apple launched push notifications, allowing users to be pinged when they were not using an app. Koum changed WhatsApp so that when a user's status is changed, everyone in the user's network would be notified.[10] WhatsApp 2.0 was released with a messaging component and the number of active users suddenly increased to 250,000. Although Acton was working on another startup idea, he decided to join the company.[10] In October 2009, Acton persuaded five former friends at Yahoo! to invest $250,000 in seed funding, and Acton became a co-founder and was given a stake. He officially joined WhatsApp on November 1.[10] After months at beta stage, the application launched in November 2009, exclusively on the App Store for the iPhone. Koum then hired a friend in Los Angeles, Chris Peiffer, to develop a BlackBerry version, which arrived two months later.[10]

On February 19, 2014, months after a venture capital financing round at a $1.5 billion valuation,[61] Facebook, Inc. announced it was acquiring WhatsApp for US$19 billion, its largest acquisition to date.[52] At the time, it was the largest acquisition of a venture-backed company in history.[51] Sequoia Capital received an approximate 5000% return on its initial investment.[62] Facebook, which was advised by Allen & Co, paid $4 billion in cash, $12 billion in Facebook shares, and (advised by Morgan Stanley) an additional $3 billion in restricted stock units granted to WhatsApp's founders Koum and Acton.[63] Employee stock was scheduled to vest over four years subsequent to closing.[52] Days after the announcement, WhatsApp users experienced a loss of service, leading to anger across social media.[64]

The acquisition caused a considerable number of users to try and/or move to other message services. Telegram claimed that it acquired 8 million new users;[65] and Line, 2 million.[66]

At a keynote presentation at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February 2014, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp was closely related to the Internet.org vision.[67][68] A TechCrunch article said this about Zuckerberg's vision:

<p>On January 18, 2016, WhatsApp's co-founder Jan Koum announced that it would no longer charge users a $1 annual subscription fee, in an effort to remove a barrier faced by users without credit cards.[80][81] He also said that the app would not display any third-party ads, and that it would have new features such as the ability to communicate with businesses.[76][82]

By June 2016, the company's blog reported more than 100 million voice calls per day were being placed on WhatsApp.[83]

On November 10, 2016, WhatsApp launched a beta version of two-step verification for Android users, which allowed them to use their email addresses for further protection.[84] Also in November 2016, Facebook ceased collecting WhatsApp data for advertising in Europe.[85]

On February 24, 2017, (WhatsApp's 8th birthday), WhatsApp launched a new Status feature similar to Snapchat and Facebook stories.[86]

On May 18, 2017, it was reported that the European Commission would fine Facebook €110 million for "misleading" it during the 2014 takeover of WhatsApp. The Commission alleged that in 2014, when Facebook acquired the messaging app, it "falsely claimed it was technically impossible to automatically combine user information from Facebook and WhatsApp." However, in the summer of 2016, WhatsApp had begun sharing user information with its parent company, allowing information such as phone numbers to be used for targeted Facebook advertisements. Facebook acknowledged the breach, but said the errors in their 2014 filings were "not intentional."[85]

In September 2017, WhatsApp's co-founder Brian Acton left the company to start a nonprofit group,[87] later revealed as the Signal Foundation, which now develops the WhatsApp competitor Signal.[88] WhatsApp also announced a forthcoming business platform to enable companies to provide customer service at scale,[89] and airlines KLM and Aeroméxico announced their participation in the testing.[90][91][92][93] Both airlines previously launched customer services on the Facebook Messenger platform.

In January 2018, WhatsApp launched WhatsApp Business for small business use.[94]

In April 2018, WhatsApp co-founder and CEO Jan Koum announced he would be leaving the company.[95] Facebook later announced that Koum's replacement would be Chris Daniels.[8]

Later in September 2018, WhatsApp introduced group audio and video call features.[96][97] In October, the "Swipe to Reply" option was added to the Android beta version, 16 months after it was introduced for iOS.[98]

On 25 November 2019, WhatsApp announced an investment of $250,000 into the startup ecosystem through a partnership with Startup India, where it will provide 500 startups with Facebook ad credits of $500 each. [99]
